# UtiliHub House Modeler — State (3/3)

**Part 3 of 3 — runtime state only.** End marker: `<!-- end:house-modeler-state.md -->`.

If truncated: re-fetch immediately. Keep this file **small** so it always loads complete.

Edit state in the **same commit** as the counting run’s code/docs change (PRODUCT / FIX-BUILD / META with work). Never a second deploy-only commit for `runs_done`.  
Identity: `andygargol2010-afk` / `andygargol2010@gmail.com`.

## RUN LIFETIME

```
runs_done: 235
runs_max: 500
```

- End of counting run → `runs_done += 1` (this file + commit).
- Never raise `runs_max` or reset without user request.
- When `runs_done >= runs_max` → pause this auto + enable Fightersland (see rules). **STOP**.

---

## FORCE FOCUS — MOBILE UI (temporary)

```
status: done
remaining_runs: 0
note: completed after PRODUCT run 163 (larger secondary controls + spacing under 768px)
```

User request 2026-10-16: next 3 executions focus on making the UI more comfortable for phone users; PC unchanged. Completed.

## MONOLITH NOTES

```
path: src/components/general/HouseModeler3D.tsx
approx_bytes: 351076
last_known_good_hint: (post clay tiles densify ~351076 bytes)
policy: prefer META when create_or_update_file would full-rewrite >300KB (tool-channel truncation risk)
Actions restore workflow_id: 375758025
```

Update `approx_bytes` / SHA after successful surgical PRODUCT or RESTORE verification.

---

## LAST RUN SNAPSHOT

```
last_mode: META
last_date: 2026-10-20
SEO_LOCALES_ACTIVE: pt (defer)
deploy: BUILDING→READY expected for 234
note: META run 235 — health check OK. Monolith 351076B / 7946 lines, gates OK (paint helpers + Sky present). Latest deploy BUILDING at start. No sandbox git push auth; chimney crown densify (courses 4→5 + soot/flecks/lime) prepared locally but deferred to avoid tool-channel truncation. Prefer authenticated local clone + push next. SEO pt active, deferred for monolith.
```

Refresh after each run.

---

## NOTES

```
Prefer local-clone surgical PRODUCT when auth available. Prefer META if only path is full rewrite >300KB via tool channel.
PRODUCT run 234: clay tiles densify (flecks 9→12, moss denser) via local clone surgical.
META run 235: health check + deferred chimney-crown densify due to no git push auth.
```
