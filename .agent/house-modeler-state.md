# UtiliHub House Modeler — State (3/3)

**Part 3 of 3 — runtime state only.** End marker: `<!-- end:house-modeler-state.md -->`.

If truncated: re-fetch immediately. Keep this file **small** so it always loads complete.

Edit + commit after each counting run (PRODUCT / FIX-BUILD / META with work).  
Identity: `andygargol2010-afk` / `andygargol2010@gmail.com`.

## RUN LIFETIME

```
runs_done: 168
runs_max: 500
```

- End of counting run → `runs_done += 1` (this file + commit).
- Never raise `runs_max` or reset without user request.
- When `runs_done >= runs_max` → pause this auto + enable Fightersland (see rules). **STOP**.

---

## FORCE FOCUS — MOBILE UI (temporary)

```
status: done
remaining_runs: 0
note: completed after PRODUCT run 163 (larger secondary controls + spacing under 768px)
```

User request 2026-10-16: next 3 executions focus on making the UI more comfortable for phone users; PC unchanged. Completed.

## MONOLITH NOTES

```
path: src/components/general/HouseModeler3D.tsx
approx_bytes: 331131
last_known_good_hint: 06d6c285e8bcb8b5eced234f4a164d03d517f734 (~331131 bytes, verified 2026-10-17 META)
policy: prefer META when create_or_update_file would full-rewrite >300KB (tool-channel truncation risk)
Actions restore workflow_id: 375758025
```

Update `approx_bytes` / SHA after successful surgical PRODUCT or RESTORE verification.

## LAST RUN SNAPSHOT

```
last_mode: META
last_date: 2026-10-17
SEO_LOCALES_ACTIVE: none
deploy: READY (prior) / BUILDING|QUEUED on latest SHA ca2dd979
note: Roll 10 → META (truncation risk for PRODUCT full rewrite). Monolith verified 331131 bytes / 7490 lines; paint helpers present; door conditional =1. No product change. Prefer local-clone surgical when auth available.
```

Refresh after each run.

## NOTES

```
Bootstrap automation only points here — expand rules in house-modeler.md / ops.
Counter source of truth: this file (not the automation prompt field).
FORCE FOCUS mobile UI: done (remaining_runs 0).
Surgical PRODUCT succeeded via local git clone + edit + push (prior runs) — sandbox push still needs auth; prefer META when risk high.
Next runs: normal roll (META/PRODUCT); prefer local-clone surgical when PRODUCT if auth available.
Unrelated catalog ERROR on older deploys does not block this surface.
Monolith SHA blob 06d6c285 verified intact this META.
```
