**Part 3 of 3 — runtime state only.** End marker: `<!-- end:ideas-lab-state.md -->`.

If truncated: re-fetch immediately. Keep this file small.

Edit + commit on every IDEATE / EXECUTE / close. Identity: `andygargol2010-afk` / `andygargol2010@gmail.com`.

## RECENT_CLOSED (max 10, newest first)

```
- 2026-11-01 | simulators | bin-packing-sim | Interactive bin packing simulator complete after 4 runs. User selects item sizes from presets, places them into a fixed container via click (CSS grid placement with overlap check), sees live utilization percentage, waste, score. Challenges/goals with restricted sets. URL deep-link (?ch=). Branded PNG of packed result. EN+ES. Mobile-first 390px. No heavy canvas; CSS + state. IP-safe original spatial packing. Acceptance: User selects items, places them, achieves high utilization or completes challenge, shares PNG or link. Run 4 polish: undo last placement, faint grid overlay for guidance, slightly larger bin max, updated instructions.
- 2026-11-01 | games | memory-match-classic | Classic memory match pairs game complete after 4 runs. Grid of face-down cards; flip two at a time to find matching pairs. Score based on moves and time. Levels with increasing pairs. Presets for themes (animals, numbers, symbols). URL deep-link for seed. Branded PNG of completed board or high score. EN+ES. Mobile-first 390px. No heavy canvas; CSS grid + state. IP-safe traditional mechanics. Acceptance met.

## ACTIVE PROJECT

```
status: active
idea: Interactive kids science experiment kit builder. User selects theme from presets (volcano, slime, simple circuit, plant growth), gets discrete materials list, follows multi-step guided assembly with checkoffs and safety tips, sees progress, estimated time, and can generate branded PNG of the completed setup or share link. Challenges for age groups. URL deep-link for theme. EN+ES. Mobile-first 390px. No heavy canvas; CSS + state + checklists. IP-safe original educational assembler.
id: science-experiment-kit
path_en: /kits/science-experiment
path_es: /es/kits/experimento-ciencia
domain: kits
runs_total: 4
runs_remaining: 2
acceptance: User selects theme, reviews materials, completes guided steps with checks, and shares PNG or link of the experiment plan/setup.
share: both
next_step_required: yes
notes: Rubric scores (value/share/search/distinct/feas/perf): A-ScienceKit 4/4/3/5/5/5=26 (closest: none particle or freehand; metaphor: multi-step guided recipe assembler with discrete parts and checkoffs; why not particle: discrete materials + sequential checklists, no trails/attractors); B-WorkoutKit 4/3/4/4/5/5=25 (closest: simple planners; metaphor: sequential routine builder); C-BudgetMealKit 3/3/4/4/5/5=24 (closest: catalog calculators; metaphor: form-to-plan). Chosen A. Domain roll: CORE kits (balance underused domain after recent simulators/games, variety mandate vs particle playgrounds). IP: n/a (original educational). Run plan: 1 core theme select + materials + steps checklist (DONE), 2 age presets/safety (DONE this run), 3 progress/PNG/share, 4 polish/mobile.
