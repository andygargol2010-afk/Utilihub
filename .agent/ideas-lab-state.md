## ACTIVE PROJECT

```
status: active
idea: Interactive narrative choice journey: user selects from branching decision cards at each stage, sees progress waypoints, reaches one of several endings with a summary visual. EN+ES routes, URL deep-link of path, shareable ending card. Not a particle sandbox.
id: choice-story-journey
path_en: /choice-story-journey
path_es: /es/viaje-historia-elecciones
path_seo: n/a
domain: journeys
runs_total: 4
runs_remaining: 3
acceptance: User clicks through 3-5 decision stages, sees branching outcomes and a final ending summary with shareable card.
share: both
next_step_required: yes
notes: Rubric (1-5): C1 CareerPath (val4/share3/search3/dist4/feas5/perf5=24) closest: education subjects, kits, streak constellation; metaphor: branching decision tree. C2 RecipeJourney (4/4/4/3/4/5=24) closest: kits assembly, modular pattern, guides; metaphor: multi-step guided assembly. C3 StoryChoice (5/4/3/5/4/5=26) closest: none interactive narrative, retention progress, search guides; metaphor: narrative choice tree with waypoints. Why not particle-canvas: discrete card decisions + progress stages, no freehand or particles. Chosen id: choice-story-journey. Roll: CORE journeys (weights, variety preference after recent simulators/playgrounds). IP: n/a (original). adsense-prep_runs: 3. Run 1: core stages/choices/endings + URL + PNG share implemented.
adsense-prep_runs: 3
