notes: IDEATE 2026-11-09. Domain roll: CORE weighted (games 6/34). Rubric scores (value/share/search/distinct/feas/perf): Cand1 MemoryMatch 5/4/4/4/5/5=27 (closest: minesweeper-grid-reveal, connect-four-grid, battleship-grid; metaphor: turn-based pair flip matching; not particle/canvas; IP: traditional public-domain concentration/memory match, generic emoji/icons). Cand2 SlidingPuzzle 4/3/3/4/5/5=24 (closest: similar grids; metaphor: slide tiles to order). Cand3 Checkers 5/4/4/4/4/5=26 (closest: battleship board, connect-four; metaphor: turn-based piece move capture). Chosen memory-match-classic highest. At least one classic. Variety: grid rules game, not saturated sandbox.
EXECUTE run 1/4 (2026-11-09): Core playable shipped — 4x4/6x4/6x6 grids, themes (fruits/animals/numbers/symbols), CSS 3D flip, timer/moves/score/stars, progress bar, URL seed deep-link, branded PNG, keyboard arrows+Enter/Space, aria-live, mobile 390px considered, EN+ES via dynamic routes. Focus-visible outline added for keyboard a11y. Acceptance path working.
